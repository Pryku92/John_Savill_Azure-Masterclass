Azure AD roles are assinged globally by default but the scope can be lmited by using administrative units.

Azure AD roles can be assigned to users and special type of group (cloud)

Administrative units can't be nested.

Privileged identity management

- enables elevation of Azure AD (and ARM) roles when needed for limited time
- can be used to elevate to a privileged group membership or ownership for limited time
- roles must be pre-assigned to be available to users
- Entra ID P2


Privileged identitiy management (PIM) is Entra ID's just in time solution.


Entra permissions management

- allows on-demand elevation
- ad-hoc (as opposed to premeditated process with PIM)
- works across clouds (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- can analyze permissions used and right size
- separate license


Access reviews

- allows to act against permissions balooning over time
- enable review on group membership, app assignment, role assignment
- reviews by different people (self-review, administrator, delegated people)
- Azure AD P2


Azure AD MFA

- Azure AD P1 or Security Defaults
- passwordless is considered phising resistant


Temporary access pass allows user to set up when using passwordless authentication.



Conditional access

- triggered for any authorization regardless of authentication method
- Azure AD P1




Continous access evaluation - ongoing communication between athenticator (app to be accessed) and the IdP.


B2B & B2C

Cross-tenant access settings provide control on B2B collaboration and inbound MFA trust.

B2C is aimed at customers as a separate type and tenant instance that is fully customizable with other types of social identity support.



Entitlement management enables access packages to be created of groups, applications, sharepoint sites.

Lifecycle workflows automate tasks associated with on and off boarding.


Azure AD DS provides a managed AD with objects replicated from AAD.
