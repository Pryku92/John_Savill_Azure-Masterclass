Privileged identity management

- enables elevation of Entra ID (and ARM) roles when needed for limited time
- can be used to elevate to a privileged group membership or ownership for limited time
- roles must be pre-assigned to be available to users
- Entra ID P2


Privileged identitiy management (PIM) is Entra ID's just in time solution.


Entra permissions management

- allows on-demand elevation
- ad-hoc (as opposed to premeditated process with PIM)
- works across clouds (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- can analyze permissions used and right size
- separate license


Access reviews

- allows to act against permissions balooning over time
- enable review on group membership, app assignment, role assignment
- reviews by different people (self-review, administrator, delegated people)
- Entra ID P2


Entra ID MFA

- Entra ID P1 or Security Defaults
- passwordless is considered phising resistant


Temporary access pass allows user to set up when using passwordless authentication.



Conditional access

- triggered for any authorization regardless of authentication method

############################# GOVERNANCE #############################

Key organizational components

- Management groups
- Subscriptions
- Resource groups


Governance capabilities

- RBAC
- Policy
- Budget
- locking (subscriptions, resource groups, resources)



Locks are inherited.

Locks work at the control plane (ARM).

Governance is about enforcement of rules and ensuring proper functioning to standards.

compliance.microsoft.com

Root management group is automatically created when first management group is created.

Subscriptions can be moved between different Entra ID tenants.

Every resource exists in a single resource group.

Resource groups cannot be nested.



RBAC

- works at all level (management group -> individual resources)
- inherited
- works at the management plane (some services support data plane actions)
- actions that can be included in an RBAC role are defined in resource providers
- can create custom roles


resources.azure.com - to see resource providers


ABAC - Attribute Based Access Control

ABAC adds conditions to role assignements based on attributes of the resources and potentially the principal accessing.



Policy

- can be used for enforcement and audit
- start with audit!
- a policy is a set of conditions built around resource attribute aliases and an effect
- can impact operations (DenyAction)
- can be grouped into initiatives for assignment and compliance




Cost management and budgets

- cost management provides insight and control of Azure (and AWS) spend
	- cost analysis
	- cost anomaly alerts
	- budgets (alerts & action groups)
- cost allocation (cost spliting of shared resources) with Enterprise Agreement or Customer Agreement
- API available
- pricing calculator



Cost optimization

- right sizing, autoscaling, serverless, shutdown unused resources
- Reserved Instances - discount for a commitment of specific resource / family in specific region for 1 or 3 years
- Azure Savings Plan - discount (lower than RI) for 1 or 3 years commitment, more flexible and broad than RI
- Azure Hybrid Benefit - allows utilization of existing Windows and SQL licenses to Azure resources


On-Demand Capacity Reservation provides SLA backed capacity availability and works with cost optimization tool (i.e. Reserved Instances).



Tagging

Tagging works on subscriptions, resource groups and resources.

Tag values can be JSON documents.

Tags can be enforced through policy.

Tags can be used for search, filter and billing.

Not inherited but can be copied through policy.

Cost management enables inheritance for usage records related to billing (the tag is not applied directly to the resource).



Blueprints & Deployment Stacks

Blueprints gather together different types of artifacts (resource groups, RBAC, ARM templates, policy, etc.) in their own construct for deployment together.

Blueprints have "ability" to deny actions (i.e. write or delete operations).

Deployment Stacs perform similar function - they are deployment of a collection of resources and perform lifecycle operations on that collection of resources.



Azure Resource Graph & Resource Configuration Changes

ARG provides way to query ARM efficiently and across subscriptions using KQL

KQL is also used in Log Analytics.

ARG can be used via portal or command line.

ARG powers Resource Configuration Changes (ResourceChanges)



Azure Advisor provides recommendations around key areas of the Azure environment.




############################# RESILIENCY #############################

Types of dangers to protect against

- software (app, OS, other) failure
- hardware failure
- corruption
- attack
- regulatory requirements
- human error


Often multiple mitigation options will be used to address different needs / threats.

Good monitoring supports resiliency.



Protecting against infrastructure failure & logical corruption



Backups / snapshots - previous point-in-time state, protects against logical corruption of data (i.e. ransomware).



Backups vs snapshots - backups are typically stored in different media.



Replication - copy of the current data stored somewhere else, protects against physical infrastructure failure.



Replication of data
- if physically close, within the same location (availability set) - synchronous - High Availability
- if physically distant, across different locations (regions pairs) - asynchronous - Disaster Recovery



RPO - Recovery Point Objective - How much data can I loose? (i.e. RPO of 5 minutes - "I can lose up to 5 minutes of data").


RTO - Recovery Time Objective - How long till I'll have to be running again?



Protecting against human errors


Humans should have as little contact with production as possible.


Taking care when using orchestration tools.


Automated deployments triggered from version control systems that have automated validation and testing.


Deployment patterns (i.e. cannary, rings, blue-green).


Established processes.




UAT - User Acceptance Testing - ??



Avoid "pets"

- everything should be able to be easily recreated from version control stored configurations (it breaks -> I delete it -> I recreate it).
- state should be in specific components of the application architecture (i.e. database)



Knowing the critical services and their dependencies

- identifying the key systems / applications
- understanding their architecture (i.e. what tiers are they made up of and where is the state?)
- understanding their dependencies (i.e. load balancers, firewall, access control, etc.)



SLA

Composite SLA - overall SLA depends on the AND / OR relationships between instances of services and application tiers.

AND relationships - multiply chances of being available - lower overall SLA

OR relationships - multiply chances of being unavailable - higher overall SLA



Testing

- application testing
- load testing
- deployment process testing
- failover testing
- restore testing
- security testing
 


Chaos engineering

Chaos engineering introduces failures into the system.

Azure Chaos Studio is a service for chaos engineering.



Blast radiuses

- Availability Set - rack / node level failure
- Availability Zone - datacenter / datacenter set level failure
- Region / Region pair




Create separate Availability Sets for different workloads (i.e. app tiers).

Datacenter set - set of datacenters sharing power, cooling, networking facilities (Availability Zone).

Every subscription has different mapping of Availability Zones - datacenter sets.

Region is defined as two milisecond latency (rtt) envelope.




Proximity Placement Group allows to place resources close together in terms of network hops and latency.



Asynchronous vs synchronous replication - synchronous within location, asynchronous across location.


Asynchronous - transactions are committed on primary as created and then sent to secondary ASAP
	- no real impact to primary performance
	- risk of data loss in unplanned failure

Synchronous - transactions are not committed on primary until acknowledged on the secondary
	- can impact primary performance
	- no risk of data loss

Asynchronous is used cross-site because of latency in nearly all scenarios.



Azure resources use of resiliency constructs

Some Azure services are global and resilient against any regional failure
	- Entra ID, Front Door, Traffic Manager, DNS zones

Most services are deployed to a specific region, with different options available
	- Regional
	- Zone-redundant
	- Zonal



Multi-region deployments

Azure regions are paired for serialized platform updates.

Multi-region deployment could be active / passive or active / active depending on the app architecture.

Some resources can't move between regions (i.e. public IP).

Need to balance between regions
	- Azure Traffic Manager
	- Azure Front Door
	- Cross-region Load Balancer
	- DNS



Use IaC

- ensures consistency
- enables rebuild
- policy to enforce consistency between deployments



Stateless workloads might not need replication - they might be rebuild with IaC.



VM replication

- on-prem to Azure (Azure Site Recovery)
	- Hyper-V VMs (host provider based)
	- VMware VMs or physical (in-guest Mobility Service)

- Azure to Azure (Azure Site Recovery)
	- uses Mobility Service via extension
	- multi-VM consistency groups

Crash and app consistent recovery points. - ??

It's possible to replicate from AWS to Azure.



Highest layer (i.e. app level) replication solution should be picked for each element in DR.

Processes can still be automated across different replication technologies with recovery plans.



Types of DR failover

- planned
	- "A storms coming, lets move our sytems to the DR location."
	- should be no data loss or unexpected outage

- unplanned
	- "Where did that storm come from and where has the datacenter gone?"
	- data loss and longer outage may occur depending on replication and process

- test
	- "Lets test the failover process, while not affecting the production, in case there is a storm one day."


Make sure DR location and plan is part of change control (is the DR environment / configuration in sync with production?).



Backup

Backup center provides unified interface for all backup solutions.

Azure provides backup services via Azure Recovery Services and Azure Backup.

They can be used by backup applications and many Azure components, also for hybrid workloads.

Delta-based storage with many recovery points.

Configurable retention settings.

Vaults can have local, zone-redundant or geo-redundant configuration.

Some services utilize their own backup techonologies (i.e. Azure SQL Database).


MUA - Multi-User Authorization

Multi-User Authorization can protect if environment is compromised.

Resource Guard has to be created in the same region as the protected service / resource.

Resource Guard may be different subscription and optionally different Entra ID tenant than the protected service / resource.

MUA applies a Resource Guard on any critical Recovery Services Vault operation.

A separate role must be granted to the backup operator for the Resource Guard before the critical operations can be performed.

There is option to turn on immutability on backup vaults.






############################# STORAGE #############################

Types of data

- structured - adhering to a strict, defined schema (i.e. databases)
- unstructured - blobs - media files, PDF documents, etc.
- semi-structured - XML, JSON


Different workloads have needs for ephemeral or durable storage.

Azure doesn't use traditional storage such as Storage Area Networks (mostly).

Azures uses a 3-tier architecture within storage stamps (clusters) - Stream Layer (data), Partition Layer (namespace), Front-End Layer (interaction).

DNS is used for the namespace (services accesses by URIs) - that's why Storage Account's name has to be unique across Azure.

Data is replicated in two ways
	- intra-stamp replication (at the stream layer) - synchronous and keeps data durable within the stamps (in the single region)
	- inter-stamp replication (at the partition layer) - asynchronous replication of data across stamps (i.e. to the paired region)



Azure Storage Account

- top-level namespace for storage services
- created in a region
- different types of storage accounts (standard vs premium)
- various redundancy (replication) settings
- supports API access
- have 2 all-powerful account keys (protect OR disable them)
- performance varies based on the account type (standard vs premium)
- supports different access tiers (varies by the service type)
- can enable monitoring and logging


Standard performance storage services are consumption-based.

Some premium storage services are provision-based (based on size).

Managed disks are always provision-based.



Access tiers

General-purpose V2 storage account:
	- hot
	- cool
	- archcive (offline)

- set at the blob level (per blob)

Files shares:
	- transaction optimized
	- hot
	- cool

- set at the file share level



Storage account services

- blob
- table (entities (key - value pairs))
- queue (FIFO (not guaranteed) messages)
- files (shares - SMB or NFS)



Blob storage

Types of blobs:

- block
- page (random operations)
- append


Block blob storage support hierarchical namespace (file system) via Azure Data Lake Storage gen. 2

Blob storage (all types) supports blob index tags (additional metadata).



Azure Storage Explorer
	- locally installed app
	- HTML 5 based
	- uses storage account keys or Entra ID integration
	- supports server-side copying of data



AzCopy - command-line tool to copy data to / from and between Storage Accounts.




Data Lake

Azure Data Lake Storage gen. 2 builds on blob

ADLSgen2 provides a data lake which is common as raw store for data pipeline (ETL & ELT).

ADLSgen2 provides true directory structure (regular blob is flat with any structure being virtual).

ADLSgen2 supports POSIX ACLs, as well as Entra ID data plane RBAC.

Data lake is mainly used for data analytics.



Statis website hosting in blob storage

A static content website can be hosted via blob storage (enabled at the storage account level).




Azure Storage access control

- Entra ID integration (data plane RBAC)
	- blob
	- queue
	- table
- account keys - can be disabled
- Shared Access Signatures (SAS) - signed with account keys (access keys need to be enabled)
	- account SAS - only ad-hoc (can't be revoked without regenerating the signing account key)
	- service SAS - ad-hoc or via Stored Access Policy (can be revoked)
- Azure Files integration with ADDS and Entra ID DS



DO NOT STORE ACCOUNT KEYS OR SAS IN APP CODE / CONFIG FILES




Encryption

- storage accounts are always encrypted at rest
- encrypted with Microsoft managed keys or Customer Managed Keys (via Azure Key Vault)
- cross-tenant Customer Managed Keys supported
- different container / blob level encryption possible via Encryption Scopes
- encryption in transit can be enforced at the storage account level




Networking

Resource Instance Rules allow access from specific instances of Azure services.




Lifecycle Management allows to move between tiers / delete blobs as defined by rules and based on modify, and access times.



Native protection

Snaphots
	- point-in-time view of blob or files share that is read-only
	- incremental storage (delta based)

Point-in-time restore
	- blob versioning
	- change feed
	- soft delete



Azure File Sync
	- single cloud endpoint per sync group
	- up to 100 servers per sync group
	- replicates via the cloud endpoint (no direct replication between servers)
	- enables cloud tiering of data to optimize local capacity




Azure Netapp Files
	- alternative for Azure File Sync
	- first-party offering using NetApp hardware in Azure datacenters
	- SMB and NFS support (also dual for single volume)
	- non-standard cross-region replication





Managed Disks
	- abstracts away the storage account
	- price based on provisioned capacity not the consumed capacity
	- some SKUs can be dynamically expanded for data disks (not OS disks)
	- limited distributed (GRS, ZRS) replication options
	- can add resiliency by aligning with Availability Sets
	- can be shared by multiple VMs (maxShares property)
	- Customer Managed Key can be used via Disk Encryption Sets which Managed Disks are placed in



VM storage
	- VMs have OS disks that normally are durable but for some can be ephemeral if state not required
	- MOST VMs have a temporary drive (SSD based) (D: or /dev/sdb1 by default) which is not-persistent
	- additional data disks can be added (number depends on VM size)


Do not use RAID sets, parity or mirrored Storage Spaces - only simple (the storage is already replicated 3 times).

Combining multiple data disks in a simple volume provides higher IOPS.



Import/Export can be used to import or export large volumes of data offline (physical disks shipping).

Azure Data Box allows to offline import / export large volumes of data by using Azure provided disks / appliances.

Data is encrypted using BitLocker.




Data governance
	- Microsoft Purview provides a data governance solution across entire data estate (also hybrid and multi-cloud).






############################# NETWORKING #############################


VNET basics
	- a virtual network exists
		- within a specific subscription
		- within a specific region
		- cannot span subscriptions nor regions
	- consists of one or more IP ranges (IPv4 and optionally IPv6), typically RFC 1918
	- address space is broken up into subnets with the smallest possible being a /29 (3 usable IPs)
	- subnets are regional and span Availability Zones


Ingress traffic (traffic coming to Azure) is free, egress traffic (traffic leaving Azure) is paid.




VM NIC
	- primary IP always comes via fabric (guest using DHCP)
	- IP can be reserved
	- VMs can be configured with multiple NICs
	- each NIC can be in same or different virtual subnet but always in the same virtual network
	- many VM types support accelerated networking
	- multiple IP configurations per NIC (secondary addresses need to be configured in guest manually)
	- IP configuration has private IP and optional public IP




Accelerated networking allows for VM NICs to use physical host's NIC directly (omitting virtual switch and associated latency).



Supported types of network traffic
	- standard IP-based protocols supported (including TCP, UDP, ICMP)
	- multicast, broadcast, IP-in-IP packet encapsulation and GRE blocked
	- pinging and traceroute do not work with the subnet gateway
	- layer 2 VLANs are not supported



IPv6
	- virtual networks are dual stack
	- IPv6 is supported by standard Azure networking features (NSG, UDR, LB, peering, etc.)
	- NIC cannot be IPv6 only
	- can enable IPv6 for existing resources
	- public IPs can be IPv6




External access
	- no delegated "DMZ" subnet where resources automatically get a public IP
	- by default Azure provides outbound SNAT/PAT enabling resources to access the Internet and receive responses



Security
	- only ports to offered services should be exposed
	- DO NOT enable RDP, SSH etc. on the internet facing IPs (i.e. use Azure Bastion instead)



SNAT
	- implicit - default SNAT/PAT
	- explicit
		- instance level public IP (not recommended)
		- Load Balancer
		- NAT Gateway


Outbound connectivity services
	- Public IP (instance level)
	- Load Balancer
	- NAT Gateway



Inbound connectivity services
	- global (not bound to specific regions)
		- Azure Front Door (L7)
		- Global Load Balancer (L4)
		- Azure Traffic Manager (L4, DNS based)
	- regional (deployed in a particular region)
		- App Gateway (L7)
		- Load Balancer (L4)

	Azure Firewall ??


Azure Bastion - managed jump box.



Bring Your Own IP
	- it's possible to bring own IP address space
	- minimum IPv4 prefix /24
	- multi-stage process (validate -> provision -> commission (advertise))



Connecting Virtual Networks
	- VNet peering enables virtual networks to be connected via the Microsoft backbone in the same or different regions (global peering)
	- there is a small ingress and egress charge for traffic via network peering (between regions ?)
	- IP address spaces cannot overlap
	- peerings can span subscriptions and Entra ID tenants
	- peerings are not transitive (can be by using UDR or Azure Virtual Network Manager)



Azure Virtual Network Manager - ??



Connecting to on-premises
	- P2S VPN - connects a specific device to a virtual network
	- S2S VPN - connects a network to a virtual network
		- S2S VPN gateways enable multiple VPN connections to different networks (route based, not policy based)
	- ExpressRoute Private Peering - connects a network to a virtual network via peering location and ExpressRoute Gateway
		- ExpressRoute circuits enable multiple virtual networks to be connected to a single circuit (for connecting VNETs better to use peering)


ExpressRoute has the benefit of not going over the internet - privacy and consistent latency.



Azure ExpressRoute pricing
	- metered - pay for the actual amount of egress traffic
	- unmetered


Global Reach - allows to connect on prem locations via Microsoft backbone



Azure Route Server - ??



ExpressRoute Fastpath
	- typically ExpressRoute Gateways are part of the data path from the Microsoft Enterprise Edge (MSEE) at the peering location to the target resource
	- Fastpath removes the gateways as part of the data path enabling higher throughput


Controlling traffic flows
	- Azure Firewall or an NVA with traffic routed to it via UDR
	- Network Security Groups (optionally using Application Security Groups and Service Tags)



Network Security Group
	- implementation of layer 4 ACLs
	- made up of rules based on IP ranges / tags, ports and actions
	- can be applied at the subnet or NIC level but are always enforced at the NIC (better to apply at the subnet level - more managable)



Service Tags
	- standard tags pointing to public IP address spaces used by different Azure services 



Azure Firewall
	- managed NVA based on VMSS
	- able to filter traffic at the layer 7
	- IDS / IPS capabilites
	- TLS inspection
	- NAT capabilites



Application Security Group
	- user defined tags applied to NICs which can be used instead of IP ranges in NSG rules
	- has to be in the same region as the NSG it's used in



Azure Virtual WAN
	- provides a managed hub
	- each region within the VWAN instance gets a hub
	- SKUs - basic / standard



Service Endpoint
	- NSGs are focused on traffic into and out of the virtual network
	- many Azure PaaS offerings have their own firwall capabilities to lock down access
	- Service Endpoints make a specific subnet known to a specific Azure service (resources in VNETs use private addressing)
	- Service Endpoints add optimal path to the service
	- the firewall on the service can be configured to allow only specific subnet made known by using Service Enpoint


When an externally facing Azure PaaS service is accessed from a resource in a VNET the traffic stays on the Azure network.



Service Enpoint Policy
	- control access to PaaS services on the VNET side
	- allows to define access only to specific instances of services from a VNET (more specific than Service Tags)
	- prevents data exfiltration



Azure Private Link / Private Endpoint
	- by default most PaaS services have an external facing endpoint
	- Private Link allows to create a Private Endpoint in a specific VNET / subnet (IP from that address space) for a specific instance of a PaaS service
	- resources in the VNET can interact via the Private Endpoint directly to the service (as if it was in the same network / subnet)
	- Private Endpoints can also point to custom services (i.e. sitting behind a load balancer) - removes the need to peer VNETs and allows to circumvent issue of overlapping IP address spaces.
	- becuase Private Endpoints are instance specific, they help prevent data exfiltration




168.63.129.16 - special Azure address - ??



DNS in Azure
	- VNETs can use Azure DNS or custom DNS
	- Azure DNS can provide public and private zones
	- VNETs can be linked to private DNS zones in addition to the built-in internal.cloudapp.net which is always present
		- 1 private zone for auto-registration
		- up to 1000 private zones for resolution
	- Private DNS Resolver service available (allows to resolve inbound and outbound queries between Azure private DNS and custom customer-managed DNS servers)






############################# VM & VMSS #############################



VM Basics
	- VMs are the building block of many services in Azure
	- full access to everything inside the VM OS and above
	- responsibility for everything OS and above (with many Azure extensions and services to help)
	- different VM series have different focus in terms of resource ratios and capabilities
	- within a series there are sizes with resources typically proportionally increasing
	- some VMs have vCPU constrained options to meet licensing requirements (limited number of vCPUs)
	- processor performance measured in ACU (Coremark)



VM Generations
	- generation 1 VMs are based on BIOS
	- generation 2 VMs are based on UEFI which enables additional (mostly security focused) technologies (i.e. trusted launch)
	- not all VM SKUs support all generations
	- VM images are generation specific as the boot architecture is different
	- VHDX is not supported
