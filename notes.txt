Privileged identity management

- enables elevation of Entra ID (and ARM) roles when needed for limited time
- can be used to elevate to a privileged group membership or ownership for limited time
- roles must be pre-assigned to be available to users
- Entra ID P2


Privileged identitiy management (PIM) is Entra ID's just in time solution.


Entra permissions management

- allows on-demand elevation
- ad-hoc (as opposed to premeditated process with PIM)
- works across clouds (Azure, AWS, GCP)
- can analyze permissions used and right size
- separate license


Access reviews

- allows to act against permissions balooning over time
- enable review on group membership, app assignment, role assignment
- reviews by different people (self-review, administrator, delegated people)
- Entra ID P2


Entra ID MFA

- Entra ID P1 or Security Defaults
- passwordless is considered phising resistant


Temporary access pass allows user to set up when using passwordless authentication.



Conditional access

- triggered for any authorization regardless of authentication method
- Entra ID P1




Continous access evaluation - ongoing communication between athenticator (app to be accessed) and the IdP.


B2B & B2C

Cross-tenant access settings provide control on B2B collaboration and inbound MFA trust.

B2C is aimed at customers as a separate type and tenant instance that is fully customizable with other types of social identity support.



Entitlement management enables access packages to be created of groups, applications, sharepoint sites.

Lifecycle workflows automate tasks associated with on and off boarding.


Entra Domain Services provides a managed AD with objects replicated from Entra ID.
